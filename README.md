# Datacrunchers Website

Datacrunchers is a student organization that focuses on promoting the machine learning, while bridging the gap between various departments/research labs, at University of Alabama-Birmingham.

This repo reflects a MERN stack based website that I'm building for the organization.

Why MERN stack? Why not LAMP or JAM?

Well, I was most familiar with MERN, and I wanted to build the site in a relatively short timespan (given other time constraints: ex: only dedicating 3-4 hours/day on the site).

Plus, I wanted to deepen my own knowledge with MERN, before trying any other stacks.

# Current Progress

- Current work is mostly focusing on building up UI/UX
- After that, a role based mechanism need to be implemented so different officers (within the organization) can have different levels of permissions.
